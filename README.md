Create Photo Note (a Polaroid camera icon)

### Create and Edit a Note

Click Create Sticky Note to place a sticky note on the middle of the scene. The scene will go automatically to __drawing mode__ and with a double click you can change the note content.

__Edit and drag the note arond is only possible in drawing mode, since they are a drawing.__ 

#### **Note** (pun intended): Only the GM can assign an image to the photo notes, unless she/he/they give you browser files permissions.

## Known Limitations

- **Refresh on Update:** The module includes a hook to ensure notes redraw when updated by others. However, if something seems out of date, try selecting/deselecting notes or refreshing the page.
