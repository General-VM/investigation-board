# Investigation Board

A Foundry VTT module that lets everyone create, edit, and move sticky and photo notes on the scene. A must-have for investigative games like City of Mist, Call of Cthulhu, and all your conspiracy adventures.

## How to Use

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c922e8d5-b168-4155-a5e3-229c06a54aa0)

Open the Journal Notes Toolbar:

On the left sidebar of the scene, select the Journal Notes tools.
Youâ€™ll see two new buttons:
Create Sticky Note (a sticky note icon)
Create Photo Note (a Polaroid camera icon)

### Create and Edit a Note

Click Create Sticky Note/Photo Note to place one of them in the middle of the scene.

The scene will automatically go to __drawing mode__, and you can change the note content with a DOUBLE CLICK.


__Edit and drag__ the note around is only possible in **drawing mode** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b6ecb10-2ab4-4328-82fb-939bbcca1f91)
, since in the end, they are a drawing. 

#### **Note** (pun intended): Only the GM can assign an image to the photo notes unless she/he/they give you browser file permissions.

If you click on the Delete button of the Drawing tools ALL NOTES WILL BE DELETED, so beware. To get rid of notes and drawings individually select them and use the Delete button on your keyboard.

There are some pretty straightforward options in the settings for the module so you can better adjust it for your table
