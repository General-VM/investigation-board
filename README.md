Open the Journal Notes Toolbar:

On the left sidebar of the scene, select the Journal Notes tools.
Youâ€™ll see two new buttons:
Create Sticky Note (a sticky note icon)
Create Photo Note (a Polaroid camera icon)

### Create and Edit a Note

Click Create Sticky Note to place a sticky note in the middle of the scene. The scene will go automatically to __drawing mode__ and with a double click you can change the note content.

__Edit and drag the note around is only possible in drawing mode ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b6ecb10-2ab4-4328-82fb-939bbcca1f91)
, since they are a drawing.__ 

#### **Note** (pun intended): Only the GM can assign an image to the photo notes unless she/he/they give you browser files permissions.

## Known Limitations

- **Refresh on Update:** The module includes a hook to ensure notes are redrawn when updated by others. However, if something seems out of date, try selecting/deselecting notes or refreshing the page.
